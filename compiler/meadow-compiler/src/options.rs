//! Compiler options — the individual switches a build turns on or off.
//!
//! Two axes, and they are independent. How hard the compiler works to make the
//! program fast ([`OptLevel`]), and how much it insists on before it will build
//! at all ([`Strictness`]). A driver bundles them into a named profile —
//! `meadow build --release` — but the compiler only ever sees the switches, and
//! either can be set on its own.
//!
//! They used to be one thing: `--release` meant "check `match` exhaustiveness",
//! which is a diagnostic and not an optimisation at all.
