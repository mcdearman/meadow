//! **Stack segments**: how an effect handler that captures its continuation
//! works on the native stack. See `docs/SILO.md`, "Effects: stack segments".
//!
//! Effects arrive as evidence passing, and a general clause is four
//! primitives: `Enter` where a `handle` begins, `Detach` where an operation
//! takes the continuation up to its handler, `Reattach` where a resumption
//! puts it back, and the one-shot flag. The emitted code hands each of the
//! first three the code that follows it, packed as a closure of one argument,
//! and returns natively with whatever the runtime answers:
//!
//! - [`meadow_enter`] runs its code on a **new segment** -- a coroutine with a
//!   stack of its own -- and answers what that code finally returns natively.
//! - [`meadow_detach`], called on the body's segment, **suspends** it and runs
//!   its code (building the resumption, calling the clause) on the handler's.
//!   A handler further out than the innermost segment suspends every segment
//!   in between: they are all part of what the continuation is.
//! - [`meadow_reattach`] resumes the suspended segments and runs its code on
//!   the innermost -- where invoking the operation's continuation, which
//!   returns natively, returns into the frames the segment kept.
//!
//! The switching is `corosensei`'s: guard pages, and on Windows the thread
//! information block kept in step, so stack probes work on a segment as on a
//! thread's own stack.
//!
//! A continuation never resumed is discarded when its stack object is
//! erased, without unwinding. What its frames were holding across calls is
//! given up all the same, from the shadow chains its segments stopped with
//! (`crate::shadow`); and its segments' stacks are given back, the ones nested
//! inside it too: an operation that passes an inner handler on its way out
//! suspends the inner segment from a `drive` frame on the outer one's stack,
//! and that frame is never unwound, so the inner segment is kept in the
//! context ([`Suspended::nested`]) rather than in the frame.
