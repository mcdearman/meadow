//! The old generation: Immix blocks and lines, never moved.
//!
//! What survives the nursery twice is promoted here, and stays at the same
//! address until it dies. That is what lets it be marked while the program
//! runs: nothing the marker reads moves under it. See [`crate::mark`] for the
//! marking, and [`crate::heap`] for how the generations fit together.
//!
//! # Blocks and lines
//!
//! The old generation is a table of [`Block`]s of [`BLOCK`] slots, each cut
//! into [`LINES`] lines of [`LINE`] slots. An old address names a block by its
//! high bits and a slot by its low ones, so reading one is two indexings.
//!
//! Space is reclaimed a **line** at a time. Marking marks every line a live
//! object covers; after a cycle, a line nothing marked is free, whatever dead
//! objects are still in it, and allocation bumps a cursor through runs of free
//! lines. No object is freed one at a time, and nothing is copied to reclaim
//! space. An object larger than a line takes the lines it covers; one larger
//! than a block takes consecutive blocks of its own.
//!
//! # Epochs
//!
//! A line records the number of the cycle that last marked it, or that
//! allocated into it -- its **epoch** -- rather than a bit that would have to be
//! cleared across the whole heap before each cycle. Between cycles, allocation
//! stamps lines with the epoch of the cycle that last finished, and a line is
//! in use if it has that stamp. While a cycle is marking, marking and
//! allocation both stamp the new epoch, and a line is in use if it has either.
//! Finishing a cycle is then one assignment: from now on only the new epoch
//! counts, and every line it did not reach is free.
//!
//! Object mark bits work the same way per block: a block's bits belong to the
//! epoch written beside them, and the first mark in a new epoch clears them.
//! So starting a cycle costs nothing per block either.
