//! **Cut**: the upper IR every front end hands Meadow's back end, as data.
//!
//! The contract is `docs/CUT.md`. A front end -- Meadow's, Idyll's -- writes a
//! program as Cut text ([`parse`] reads it back); the reference interpreter
//! ([`interp`]) runs it, and what it answers and prints is what the program
//! means; and the lowering takes it to AxCut for Glade and Silo. Nothing here
//! knows any front end.
//!
//! Cut is a sequent calculus typed by representations: producers make values,
//! consumers receive them, and a statement is one meeting the other. A
//! function is codata with an `apply` method, a continuation is a consumer,
//! and a program is the declarations a runtime needs and the definitions that
//! run.
