//! Which channel this `meadow` was built for, and what that lets a package
//! ask of it.
//!
//! The split is Rust's. A **stable** build is a release with a version that
//! does not move, and it accepts only what the language promises to keep. A
//! **nightly** build is `master` on some day, and accepts features that are
//! still unsettled, each named at the top of the root module of the package
//! that uses it, as `#![feature(…)]` is at the top of a crate's:
//!
//! ```text
//! @!feature(ffi)
//!
//! use Std.Ffi as Ffi
//! ```
//!
//! A build from a checkout is **dev**, and takes what nightly takes. These
//! are not the features a package offers the ones that build it, which are
//! `[features]` in its `Meadow.toml` and work on every channel.
//!
//! The channel is decided when `meadow` is built -- `MEADOW_CHANNEL`, which
//! the release workflows set; see `build.rs` -- so a binary cannot be talked
//! into another one.
