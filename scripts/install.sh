#
# This is for working on Meadow, or for a machine with no release build. To

#
# Builds the whole toolchain from source -- `meadow`, the build system, and
# `meadowup`, which looks after which version of Meadow you have -- and installs
# both. Nothing is downloaded but the source. It needs a Rust toolchain and takes
# a few minutes.
#
# What ends up on disk is exactly what `meadowup install` would have put there:
# the binaries in ~/.meadow/bin, and your PATH edited to find them. That is
# because meadowup does the installing -- the one just built is handed the
# binaries beside it rather than fetching any -- so there is one implementation
# of where things go, whichever way they were made. And since meadowup is
# installed too, `meadowup update` moves a source build on to the next release
# like any other install.
#
# Working on Meadow itself? `--local .` builds this checkout, and
# `--with-extension` builds and installs the VS Code extension alongside it.
#
# Run with --help for the options.

Builds the Meadow toolchain from source and installs it.

    scripts/install.sh [options]

    --version <TAG>    build that tag, rather than the newest source
    --local <PATH>     build a checkout already on disk
    --with-extension   also build and install the VS Code extension
    --no-modify-path   do not touch your shell profiles
    --uninstall        remove Meadow and undo the PATH entry

Both `meadow` and `meadowup` are built and installed, laid out exactly as
`meadowup install` would lay them out. Building needs a Rust toolchain and
takes a few minutes.

Afterwards, `meadowup` looks after the installation:

    meadowup update       move on to the latest release
    meadowup show         what is installed, and where
    meadowup uninstall

MEADOW_HOME overrides where everything goes. To install a release rather
than build one, use scripts/meadowup-init.sh.
