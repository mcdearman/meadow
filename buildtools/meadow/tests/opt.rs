//! they go wrong is a program that still runs and computes something else.
//!
//! The three that are always on:
//!
//! * a literal operand folded into the instruction that uses it — which must not
//!   quietly swap the operands of something that cares which side they are on;
//! * a comparison fused into the branch testing it — which must not invert;
//! * arguments read where they already sit instead of being copied into a fresh
//!   window — which must not read the wrong registers.
//!
//! And the one `-O2` turns on: a `match` compiled to a decision tree, which must
//! pick the same arm the chain would have, including when the arms overlap.
