//! Effects must not go missing from a type. Each test below was accepted, or
//! printed a type with an effect missing, before the fix it guards.
//!
//! ## Lets
//!
//! A `let` whose right-hand side calls a function *parameter* must keep that
//! call's effect.
//!
//! The parameter's latent effect is a row variable, and a row variable used to
//! count as "pure" when deciding whether a binding contributes its effect to
//! the enclosing function and whether it may be generalized. So in
//! `fun each f xs = ... let _ = f x in ...` the `! e` vanished from `each`'s
//! type: `each (\x -> log x) xs` then type-checked as a pure call, a
//! `Log`-performing closure could be stored where a pure function was required,
//! and a binding like `let r = f ()` was generalized even when `f` allocated.
//!
//! ## Handlers
//!
//! A handler discharges only what it answers. An operation with no clause goes
//! straight past it at run time, so its effect is still performed as far as
//! the enclosing code is concerned. The rule used to take the first clause's
//! effect as handled in full, give clauses of any second effect unchecked
//! types, and drop the body's whole row when there was no clause at all.
