//! **Macro expansion**: `name!(…)`.
//!
//! A macro call is parsed as a name and an opaque argument -- balanced brackets
//! and nothing more -- so this is where it first means anything. Expansion runs
//! after [`crate::cfg`] and before name resolution, and every call is gone by
//! the time it finishes: replaced by what the macro produced, or reported and
//! replaced by something harmless so the rest of the module still compiles.
//!
//! What a macro produces is **tokens**, which are then parsed with the entry
//! point for the position the call was in ([`meadow_parser::parse_expr`] and
//! friends). Nothing here builds a tree directly. That is what keeps a macro
//! unable to say anything the language could not: if it does not parse, it is
//! an error, exactly as it would be written out by hand.
//!
//! A module's `macro` declarations are read first and are gone before anything
//! else looks: a macro is not a value, so there is nowhere past here to put
//! one. Reading them all up front is also what lets a macro be called above
//! where it is written, as every other top-level name can be.
//!
//! These built-ins are always available, and a `macro` may not take one of
//! their names:
//!
//! | call | answers |
//! |---|---|
//! | `line!()` | the line the call is written on |
//! | `file!()` | the name of the file it is written in |
//! | `stringify!(…)` | its argument, written back as text |
//! | `concat!(a, b, …)` | its literal arguments, joined into one string |
//! | `quote! { … $x … }` | an expression building those tokens, `$x` spliced (see [`quote`]) |
