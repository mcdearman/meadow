# Everything `scripts/check.sh` runs, and the release workflow's smoke test,
# side by side: what to run on a commit before it is pushed.
#
#   scripts/check-parallel.sh                     every check, at once
#   scripts/check-parallel.sh --version v0.2.0    ...plus: the tag matches
#   scripts/check-parallel.sh --root DIR          ...of the checkout at DIR
#
# `check.sh` runs its steps one after another, which is what CI wants: one
# log, read top to bottom. On a machine with cores to spare that is most of
# an hour where this is about ten minutes. Each job writes a log of its own,
# and at the end there is one line for each: `ok` or `FAIL`.
#
# It also runs what `check.sh` does not and `release.yml` does: a release
# build as a stable `meadow`, with the standard library compiled into it, and
# the smoke test of that build. A tag whose release cannot pass that is found
# here rather than after it is pushed.
#
# The jobs share nothing they write. Each `cargo` has a target directory of
# its own under `target-check/`, the collector's stress runs test copies of
# the examples, and the standard library is compiled once before anything
# reads it. Run one of these at a time in a checkout: two would be two builds
# of MeadowBoot in one directory. It wants about 40 GB of disk for a
# checkout, most of it under `target-check/`, which can be deleted after.
#
# `--root` is for checking a checkout that does not have this script, an
# older commit say, with this one.
