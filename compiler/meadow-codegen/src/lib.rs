//! AxCut → bytecode.
//!
//! The back end. Everything the sequent IR says about control — continuations,
//! handlers, the duality between calling and returning — is compiled away here,
//! and what comes out is a flat instruction array over a flat register file.
//! `meadow_glade` never learns any of it.
//!
//! # Why this pass is short
//!
//! Because AxCut already did the hard part. Its environment is an **ordered
//! list**, and a block's parameters name the whole of it, so at every program
//! point the set of live values and their order is written down in the IR. That
//! is the information a register allocator normally has to recover by computing
//! liveness, and here it is simply read off.
//!
//! What is left is bookkeeping of three kinds:
//!
//! * **Renaming is free.** `substitute [x, y] in {(a, b) => s}` emits *no code*
//!   at all when the block is laid out inline — it is a change of names, and the
//!   values are already in registers. Same for a `switch` arm and for the
//!   continuation of a primitive. Moves appear only at [`Statement::Jump`] and
//!   [`Statement::Invoke`], the two places control actually leaves — and often
//!   not even there. An instruction that wants a window of consecutive registers
//!   reads the environment where it already sits whenever the environment
//!   already has that shape, which it usually does: see [`Gen::gather`]. Reusing
//!   registers makes that a little less often true — an environment whose
//!   registers were reused is no longer in ascending order — and a window that
//!   has to be filled is the price of the moves that reuse removes. An
//!   instruction that builds an object pays nothing either way: where its
//!   fields are not one run it lists them instead ([`Gen::list`]).
//! * **A jump needs a permutation.** The target block wants its parameters in
//!   `r0..rn`, so [`Gen::parallel_move`] emits the moves — breaking cycles with
//!   one scratch register, which is the only place this pass has to think.
//! * **Blocks get laid out and patched.** A `new` puts its methods somewhere
//!   reachable and records their addresses in a method table.
//!
//! # Halting is an ordinary invoke
//!
//! Instruction 0 is `halt r1`, and the machine starts with `r0` holding a
//! closure whose one method is that instruction. A program's entry block takes
//! one parameter — the continuation to answer with — so "return from `main`"
//! needs no special case anywhere: it is the same `invoke` as every other
//! return, and it happens to land on a `halt`. The closure captures the
//! descriptor of the answer, which arrives after it, in `r1`.
//!
//! # Typed instructions
//!
//! A primitive whose operands are both `Int`, or both `Float`, is emitted as a
//! typed instruction -- `addi`, `cmpf`, `brik` -- that does its work on the
//! words themselves, with no operand descriptors and nothing to decode. The
//! representations come from the names (`meadow_seq::Rep`), so it is exactly
//! the code whose types are known that gets them: generic code keeps the
//! primitive, and specializing it is what turns it typed. See
//! [`Gen::typed_value`] and [`Gen::typed_test`].
//!
//! # Saying what registers hold
//!
//! A register is a word, so everything the machine has to know about one is
//! written beside the code: a register map at each instruction that can
//! collect, and operand descriptors at each that has to read a value --
//! see [`Gen::safepoint`] and [`Gen::operands_for`].
//!
//! # Registers are reused
//!
//! A name's register comes free at its last use, and the IR says where that is:
//! [`meadow_seq::still_used`] reads it off a statement rather than computing
//! liveness. At every binder the environment handed to what follows has the
//! names nothing below reads taken out of it, so the next `let`, `new` or
//! `extern` writes its result into one of them. The important case is that
//! **capturing a name is a use of it** — once a closure holds a copy, the
//! methods' reads are the methods' business — so a continuation built out of
//! the environment lands on top of what it closed over instead of one register
//! higher, and the transfer after it needs no permutation to put things back.
//! `fib`'s recursive call went from five instructions to three this way.
//!
//! There are two places it stops. A `jump` into a labelled block and an
//! `invoke` of a method hand the environment on whole, position for position,
//! to a block compiled separately against it — so nothing may be dropped on a
//! path that reaches one, which is what `still_used` answering `None` means. A
//! `substitute` then rebuilds a full environment out of its selection, and
//! from there the shapes `meadow_seq` believes in are true again. See
//! [`Gen::narrow`] and [`Gen::enter`].
//!
//! # Spilling
//!
//! An operand names one of 255 registers, and a block can have more values
//! live than that: an 800-element literal binds all its elements before it
//! builds anything, and generated code can hold hundreds of names across a
//! run of calls. The file has no memory behind it -- it is 256 words, and a
//! jump hands it over whole -- so what does not fit goes to the heap, with
//! instructions the machine already has:
//!
//! * **Spilling** packs a group of live values into a block (`MakeData`,
//!   described field by field like any other) held in one register, and
//!   frees theirs. It happens where a statement begins with more than
//!   [`SPILL_ABOVE`] registers in use, down to [`SPILL_TO`], and takes the
//!   values in the highest registers -- which also lowers the top of the
//!   file, where windows are laid. Never a descriptor: other values are read
//!   through those. See [`Gen::make_room`].
//! * **Reloading** is a `Field` from the block, where a statement reads the
//!   value. A spilled value keeps its place in the environment, which is an
//!   ordered list -- a `jump` and an `invoke` hand it over by position -- and
//!   only where it is changes. Those two reload everything first.
//! * **A closure or frame** captures the spill blocks rather than what they
//!   hold, and its methods are entered knowing which captures are fields of
//!   which block: see [`Plan`]. So a non-tail call with three hundred values
//!   live builds a continuation of a few dozen.
//! * **An array literal** longer than [`ARRAY_CHUNK`] is built in pieces
//!   joined by `arrayConcat`, each piece's elements given up once it is built.
//! * **A constructor** of more than [`WIDE`] fields is made blank (`Blank`)
//!   and filled a field at a time by `setField`; **a record** that wide is
//!   made of its first fields and extended by the rest. Matching on such a
//!   constructor binds its fields where they are -- fields of the scrutinee,
//!   loaded when read -- rather than all at once.
//! * **A jump or an invoke** handing over more than [`ARGS_ABOVE`] values
//!   passes the first [`ARGS_KEPT`] in registers and the rest packed in
//!   blocks, and the block or method entered knows to look there: the same
//!   rule at both ends, [`arg_slots`], so that neither has to see the other.
//!
//! # What is not done yet
//!
//! **A continuation per non-tail call.** `meadow_seq` no longer builds one for
//! every subexpression — anything that cannot transfer control is lowered where
//! it stands, and a saturated call to a known function is a jump — so a tail
//! loop now allocates nothing at all. What remains is structural rather than an
//! oversight: a call in argument position has to record where to come back
//! to. That record used to be a heap object, four words allocated per call.
//! It is now a frame ([`Op::Frame`]) on a chunked frame stack, popped when the
//! function returns through it -- `meadow_seq::Program::frames` says which
//! `new`s are these. The worry about a stack was copying it whenever a
//! continuation is captured, which one-shot effect handlers do constantly;
//! chunks answer it, because a `handle` starts a chunk of its own and a
//! capture unlinks whole chunks instead of copying frames. See
//! `docs/RUNTIME.md`, "The call stack is a frame stack".
