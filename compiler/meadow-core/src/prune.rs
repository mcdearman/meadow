//! **Pruning: only the definitions a program can reach.**
//!
//! A program is its own definitions and every one of its dependencies', so a
//! one-line program that prints a string arrives with the whole standard
//! library: a thousand definitions, of which it uses three. Lowering and code
//! generation are whole-program passes, and do all thousand.
//!
//! [`prune`] keeps the definitions the entry point reaches -- through the
//! variables their terms mention, transitively -- in the order they were in,
//! and drops the rest. What it keeps runs exactly as it did: a definition only
//! ever reaches another by naming it, and the tables that are not definitions
//! (constructors' fields, data types' variants) stay whole.
//!
//! [`Deps`] is the part worth keeping between programs that share their
//! dependencies, as every line of a REPL does: each definition's references,
//! found once, so that pruning the next program only walks the edges.
