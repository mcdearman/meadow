//! One debugging session: a program built for debugging, running on the VM,
//! and everything a debugger asks of it -- where it is, what the names hold, and
//! how far to run before stopping again.
//!
//! Nothing here speaks the protocol. [`super`] turns requests into calls on a
//! [`Session`] and its answers back into messages, which keeps this testable
//! with ordinary Rust and keeps the protocol code dull.
//!
//! # A call stack for a machine without one
//!
//! The VM has no call stack: returning from a function is invoking the
//! continuation it was given, and that continuation is a heap object. It is
//! still a stack in every way that matters to a person reading one -- the
//! continuation captures what the caller will need when it resumes, including
//! *its* continuation -- so [`Session::frames`] walks that chain. The compiler
//! records which names are return continuations
//! ([`meadow_bytecode::DebugInfo::returns`]) and which name each register and
//! each capture holds, and that is enough to draw the stack a source-level
//! debugger would.
//!
//! # Where a step stops
//!
//! At a *boundary*: the first instruction of a source position (a call, a
//! branch, a body -- see `meadow_core::Term::Loc`). Stepping over and out
//! compare return continuations rather than counting frames: the frame a step
//! began in is identified by the continuation it will answer, which the VM keeps
//! current across collections ([`meadow_rts::Vm::pinned`]). Counting frames
//! would mean walking the whole chain at every boundary, which a deep recursion
//! makes quadratic.
