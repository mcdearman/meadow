//! **Collecting cycles, without ever tracing from roots.**
//!
//! Counting misses a cycle: two blocks that hold each other keep one another's
//! count above zero after the last reference from outside is gone. The usual
//! answer is a tracing collector as a backstop, and this runtime cannot have
//! one -- a program compiled ahead of time keeps its values in native frames
//! and registers, with no map saying which slots hold references, so there is
//! no way to enumerate the roots.
//!
//! What works without roots is **trial deletion**, from Bacon and Rajan,
//! _Concurrent Cycle Collection in Reference Counted Systems_ (ECOOP 2001).
//! Take a block whose count went down without reaching zero -- a cycle, if
//! there is one, must contain such a block -- and ask a local question: if the
//! references *inside* this subgraph did not exist, would anything still point
//! at it? Subtract the internal edges and see whose count reaches zero. Those
//! are reachable only from each other, which is what garbage means, and the
//! answer needs nothing but the subgraph itself.
//!
//! The three passes, over the buffered candidates:
//!
//! 1. **Mark**: from each candidate, walk the subgraph colouring it gray and
//!    taking one off the count of every block an edge inside it points to.
//!    What is left in a count is the references from outside.
//! 2. **Scan**: a gray block whose count says something outside still points
//!    at it is alive, and so is everything it reaches: colour those black and
//!    put back what the mark pass took. Everything else is white.
//! 3. **Collect**: the white blocks are a garbage cycle. Free them. Their
//!    edges to live blocks are already accounted for, because the mark pass
//!    took those references away and the scan pass did not put them back.
//!
//! Nothing at all for a program that cannot make a cycle. A cycle needs a
//! store into a block that already exists, which in Meadow is `setRef` or a
//! write into a mutable array; immutable data is built bottom-up and points
//! only backwards. The compiler looks for those two primitives, and a program
//! without them is emitted with no candidate buffering in its counting helpers
//! and no collector in its runtime (`meadow_llvm::emit`, `cycles`).
//!
//! # What it does not catch
//!
//! Only a `Ref` and a mutable array are kept as candidates, since every cycle
//! must contain one and the program must have been holding it to tie the knot
//! -- so letting go of it is a candidate, and that is how the cycles people
//! actually write are found. A cycle whose `Ref` is let go of *while the cycle
//! is still alive*, and which becomes garbage later when something else lets
//! go of a block that is not a `Ref`, is not noticed: nothing buffers a
//! candidate at that last moment. That cycle leaks, as every cycle did before
//! this module existed.
//!
//! Keeping every block that is decremented, which is what the algorithm as
//! published does, closes that hole and costs 11% of `wordfreq` and 27% of
//! `binarytrees` in buffering alone, on programs that never make a cycle at
//! all. The trade is written down here rather than made quietly.
//!
//! # What it costs, and when it runs
//!
//! For a program that can, the collector runs from [`crate::heap::acquire`]
//! once [`TRIGGER`] candidates have gathered, and looks at [`BATCH`] of them,
//! leaving the rest for the next run. The pause is what one batch reaches:
//! the garbage it finds, and the live blocks on that garbage's edge. Not the
//! live set, and not the whole heap.
//!
//! So the pause does not grow with how much garbage has piled up -- that is
//! spread over runs -- but it does grow with the size of a single cycle,
//! since a cycle is freed in the run that proves it garbage or not at all.
//! One cycle holding a list of a million nodes is one long pause, and no
//! batching helps; bounding that needs the walk itself to be incremental,
//! which needs a write barrier this runtime does not have.
