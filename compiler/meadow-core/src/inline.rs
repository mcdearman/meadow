//! **Inlining a small top-level function at the places that call it.**
//!
//! # In the pipeline
//!
//! `meadow_seq::lower_program` runs this after `bools` and before `joins`, at
//! [`OptLevel::inlines`] -- a release build. A debug build keeps every call a
//! call, so that the debugger has frames to show and lines to stop at.
//! It was written and left out for a while, because turning it on broke two
//! differential tests against the CEK machine, and neither was this pass's
//! fault: they were shapes lowering had never been given before. A record
//! accessor inlined at a record literal is a `match` on the literal, and
//! lowering typed a literal's fields as nothing, so the field it selected had
//! no representation; and a jump to a join point whose argument has to be
//! evaluated first has to keep the join's environment alive meanwhile, which
//! lowering's free-variable expansion knew for `letrec` bindings and not for
//! join points. Both are fixed in `lower.rs`, where they belonged.
//!
//! A mention of a top-level name lowers to a *jump to its definition*, and a
//! jump is a transfer of control — so a call that is not in tail position has
//! to record where to come back to, and a machine with no call stack records
//! that as an object on the heap. That is the right price for a function. It is
//! a ruinous one for
//!
//! ```text
//! @pub fun get a i = stGetArray a i
//! ```
//!
//! which is what `Std.St`'s array accessors are: one line each, wrapping a
//! primitive that cannot transfer control at all. Lowering emits a primitive
//! where it stands, so `stGetArray a i` written out costs one instruction — and
//! `St.get a i`, which means exactly that, cost a closure, an indirect call, a
//! jump and a return. A matrix multiply's inner loop is three of these, so it
//! paid for six continuations and six calls per element to do three loads and a
//! store.
//!
//! # What is inlined
//!
//! A definition is a candidate when it is
//!
//! * **a function**: some lambdas, then a body;
//! * **type-applied at the call site** if it is polymorphic, so that its body
//!   can be instantiated. Core is still typed here and a name's representation
//!   comes from its type all the way down to code generation, so a copy of a
//!   body has to carry the types that copy is *for* — see [`retype`]. This is
//!   not an optional refinement: eleven of the thirteen definitions a matrix
//!   multiply reaches are polymorphic, `Std.St`'s array accessors among them,
//!   because they are generic in the state type `runSt` invents. Refusing them
//!   left this pass with nothing to do. A specialized copy (see
//!   [`crate::specialize`]) is mentioned with the type arguments of the
//!   definition it was copied from, and is instantiated at the ones for the
//!   binders it kept -- see [`Body::instantiation`] and [`candidates`];
//! * **not recursive**, directly or through any chain of definitions — which is
//!   computed rather than guessed at, because a wrapper calling a wrapper is the
//!   ordinary case and refusing those would leave most of the library alone;
//! * **small**, under [`BUDGET`] nodes.
//!
//! and the call is **saturated**: exactly as many arguments as parameters.
//! Anything else is left as it is.
//!
//! # Why it is safe to copy a body
//!
//! Core binds every name once, and the rest of the compiler relies on it:
//! [`crate::simplify`] substitutes without renaming for that reason, and
//! `meadow_seq` numbers its environment by it. A body copied to two call sites
//! would break it. So every copy is [`freshen`]ed first — every binder in it,
//! and every mention of one, given a number nothing else has.
//!
//! The arguments become `let`s rather than being substituted, which keeps them
//! evaluated once and in order whatever the body does with its parameters.
//! [`crate::simplify`] then removes the ones that cost nothing to copy, which
//! is most of them, so `St.get a i` really does end up as the primitive and
//! nothing else.
