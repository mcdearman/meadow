//! Build **profiles** — the driver-level names for a bundle of compiler options.
//!
//! A profile is what a user selects (`meadow build --release`); it expands to a
//! [`meadow_compiler::Options`] before anything reaches the compiler. Keeping the
//! bundle here means the compiler itself only ever sees individual switches, and
//! new ones (optimization levels, debug info) can join a profile without the CLI
//! growing a flag each.
//!
//! Three layers, each overriding the one before it:
//!
//! 1. the profile's built-in meaning — [`Profile::options`];
//! 2. the package's `[profile.<name>]` section, if it has a manifest -- or its
//!    workspace root's, if it is in a workspace;
//! 3. flags on the command line.
//!
//! [`Resolved`] is what that produces. The built-in layer is what makes a
//! manifest optional, and the manifest layer is what lets a package say
//! `opt-level = 2` in debug builds without every `meadow run` needing a flag.
