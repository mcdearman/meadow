//! **A green thread's context**: everything the runtime keeps for one thread
//! -- its heap, its stack segments, its literals and top-level values, its
//! transaction -- apart from every other thread's, so that none of it is ever
//! touched by two OS threads at once and counting needs no atomics.
//!
//! A thread moves between OS threads (`crate::sched`), so what is "current"
//! is set by the worker that resumes it, and read through [`get`] -- which is
//! never inlined. That matters: code that waits, and so may resume on another
//! OS thread, must not keep an OS thread's thread-local address from before
//! the wait, and a call LLVM cannot see into, made after the wait, is what
