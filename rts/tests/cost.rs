//! What a program *costs*, asserted rather than timed.
//!
//! Instruction counts and allocation counts are deterministic — the same program
//! costs the same every run, on every machine — so they can be asserted exactly
//! where a wall clock could only be eyeballed. That makes this a regression test
//! for optimisations rather than a benchmark: a change that quietly reintroduces
//! an allocation per loop iteration fails here, on a laptop, in a second.
//!
//! The bounds are set a little above what the compiler currently achieves, so
//! ordinary noise in code generation does not trip them and a real regression
//! does. If a change *improves* one, tighten it — the number in the assertion is
//! a claim about the compiler, and it should stay true.
