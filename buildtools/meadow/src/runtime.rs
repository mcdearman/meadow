//! Which machine runs the program.
//!
//! Two back ends, one interface. The **bytecode VM** is the default: `core` is
//! lowered to the AxCut IR, compiled to registers, and run by `meadow_glade`. The
//! **CEK machine** (`meadow_eval`) is still there behind `--cek`, and is still
//! the specification — if the two disagree the CEK is right and the VM has a
//! bug, so the flag is the first thing to reach for when a program does
//! something inexplicable.
//!
//! Both are held to that by tests rather than by intention: `tests/vm.rs` runs
//! the whole standard library through both and requires every answer to match.
//!
//! # What the VM cannot do yet
//!
//! Discharge an *unhandled* `Fs`, `Process`, `Random` or `Time` operation. The
//! CEK reaches the real world for those; the VM reports them and stops. A
//! program that handles its effects — which is every test in the standard
//! library, by design — is unaffected, and one that reads a file is not, so that
//! is what `--cek` is for until the natives are ported.
