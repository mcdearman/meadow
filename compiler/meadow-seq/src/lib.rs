//! **AxCut** — a machine-level sequent-calculus IR.
//!
//! From Schuster, Müller, Ostermann and Brachthäuser, *Compiling Classical
//! Sequent Calculus to Stock Hardware: The Duality of Compilation* (OOPSLA
//! 2025). The grammar below follows the artifact's `Syntax.idr`; the abstract
//! machine in [`crate::machine`] follows its `Semantics.idr`.
//!
//! # What makes it a machine language
//!
//! A textbook sequent calculus (λμμ̃ — the one in "Grokking the Sequent
//! Calculus") has producers, consumers, and a *cut* `⟨p | c⟩` that runs one
//! against the other. A cut is a redex. Cut elimination is not a pass that runs
//! before the program does — it *is* the reduction relation, and a program with
//! no cuts left in it is a program that has already finished.
//!
//! So AxCut does not remove cuts. It **restricts** them. There is no `Cut`
//! constructor because a cut is never a node of its own here: every one of the
//! seven statements below *is* a cut, with the rule it cuts against fused into
//! it. The paper's normal form is reached by pushing cuts until a variable — an
//! axiom — stands on one side, which is what the name says: `Ax` for the axiom
//! rule, `Cut` for the cut that meets it.
//!
//! Which rule a cut meets is also what decides memory, and that pairing is the
//! paper's central trick:
//!
//! ```text
//!   let, new         a cut against an *activation* rule    acquires memory
//!   switch, invoke   a cut against an *axiom* (deactivation)  releases it
//! ```
//!
//! `substitute` is the structural rules written down. In the paper, duplicating
//! a name shares the memory behind it and dropping one erases it — a pair of
//! reference-count operations — so a well-typed AxCut program manages its own
//! memory and needs no collector at all. **Meadow takes neither half of that**:
//! it collects instead of counting, so `switch` and `invoke` free nothing and
//! `substitute` counts nothing. See [Linearity](#linearity).
//!
//! What remains either way is seven statements and no expressions whatsoever.
//!
//! The consequence that matters, and the reason for the whole exercise:
//!
//! > **`Jump` and `Invoke` take no arguments.**
//!
//! Arguments are not passed. They are already *in the environment*, in the right
//! order, because a [`Statement::Substitute`] put them there. The environment is
//! an ordered list — a register file — and `Substitute` is the only thing that
//! rearranges it. Code generation for a call is therefore a permutation of
//! registers followed by a branch, and register allocation stops being a search
//! problem: the IR already says where everything goes.
//!
//! # The seven statements
//!
//! ```text
//!   substitute [x, y] in {(a, b) => s}   rebuild the environment as [x, y]
//!   jump L                               tail-jump; environment unchanged
//!   let z = K#2(x, y); s                 build a data value
//!   switch x { K#2 => s0, else => s1 }   branch on a tag, binding the fields
//!   new f {…methods…} capturing [x]; s   build codata: a closure, or a handler
//!   invoke f#0                           call a method
//!   extern add(x, y) { {(r) => s} }      a primitive; its blocks are its
//!                                        continuations
//! ```
//!
//! Like the paper's, this AxCut has **no effect handlers**. Effekt compiles
//! effects away before reaching it, and so does Meadow now: `handle` and
//! `perform` lower to evidence passing -- objects, data and jumps -- and an
//! operation no handler answers becomes an [`Extern::Native`]. See
//! `lower`'s module docs.
//!
//! Data (`let` / `switch`) and codata (`new` / `invoke`) are exact duals, which
//! is the "duality" of the title. A closure is codata with one method. A
//! *continuation* is also codata with one method — which is why returning from a
//! function is `invoke ret#0` and needs no separate mechanism, and why an effect
//! handler's clauses and resumptions are ordinary objects rather than special
//! forms.
//!
//! # Linearity
//!
//! The paper's environment is linear: a statement consumes exactly the names it
//! mentions, and `Substitute` is what duplicates, drops and reorders. This crate
//! **does not enforce that** — see [`Statement::Substitute`]. Names are checked
//! for scope, not for use count.
//!
//! That is one deviation with two consequences, and it is worth being plain
//! about which is which. The paper spends its linearity on *memory*: because
//! every name is used once, a cut against an axiom knows the object it leaves
//! behind is dead and can release it there and then. Meadow does not want that
//! half — it has a generational collector, green threads with a heap each, and
//! [`Statement::Switch`] deliberately keeps its scrutinee so that
//! `match o with | Just x -> o` works. The half it does want is *register
//! allocation*: with use counts on the IR the allocator could read its answer
//! off `Substitute` instead of computing it. So linearity here would be an
//! optimization, not the memory discipline it is in the paper.
