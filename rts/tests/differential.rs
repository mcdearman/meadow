//! The CEK machine is the specification; this checks the whole back end against
//! it.
//!
//! Each case is Meadow source, compiled once to `core` and then run **three
//! ways**:
//!
//! | | what it tests |
//! |---|---|
//! | `meadow_eval` | nothing — it *is* the specification |
//! | `meadow_seq::machine` | the lowering to AxCut, with no registers involved |
//! | `meadow_rts` | that, plus code generation, register allocation and the GC |
//!
//! Running the middle one matters even though the VM is what ships. When a case
//! fails, which of the two disagrees says immediately whether the bug is in the
//! translation or in the back end — and the AxCut machine additionally refuses
//! to enter a block whose parameters do not cover the whole environment, so a
//! lowering that miscounts what is live fails there with a shape error rather
//! than a wrong number.
//!
//! Agreement is on the printed result, because all three print the same way on
//! purpose. Anything the lowering cannot translate is asserted *loudly*: a case
//! that silently reported `Unsupported` and passed would be worse than no case.
