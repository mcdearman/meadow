//! **Top-level definitions, evaluated once.**
//!
//! A mention of a top-level name lowers to a jump to its definition, so without
//! this pass `def table = build 1000000` builds the table again at every use.
//! That is only a matter of speed, because a top-level `def` other than `main`
//! cannot perform effects -- the type checker refuses one that does -- and
//! evaluating a pure expression twice gives the same value twice.
//!
//! So each definition that is not a function gets a cache. Its body becomes
//!
//! ```text
//! if cached i then cached-value i
//! else let v = <body> in let _ = cache i v in v
//! ```
//!
//! with the three [`Prim::GlobalReady`], [`Prim::GlobalGet`] and
//! [`Prim::GlobalSet`], where `i` is the definition's position. The first use
//! computes and keeps the value; every later one reads it back. A definition
//! nothing uses is never evaluated, and one that fails is not cached, so it
//! fails the same way wherever it is used.
//!
//! A function needs none of this: its value is the closure, which is as cheap to
//! make as to look up, and calling it is supposed to run it every time. Nor does
//! a literal, or the entry point, which the runtime evaluates exactly once. A
//! definition generic over a type cannot have it: its value is made from the
//! descriptors of the types it is used at, which differ from use to use.
//!
//! The cache belongs to the machine running the code. On the bytecode VM that is
//! one green thread, and each keeps its own -- a thread never reads another's
//! heap -- so a definition is computed at most once per thread that uses it.
//! Runs on erased core, just before lowering.
