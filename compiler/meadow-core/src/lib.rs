//! **Core: a typed lambda calculus that every front-end feature lowers to.**
//!
//! Inference runs on the HIR; once a program type-checks we translate it here.
//! Core is deliberately tiny — single-argument lambdas and applications,
//! explicit recursion, primitives already resolved, pattern matching reduced to
//! `Case` plus tuple and record projection.
//!
//! # Why it is typed
//!
//! It is **System F**, near enough: every binder carries its type, every
//! generalized binding is a [`Term::TyLam`], and every mention of a
//! polymorphic name is a [`Term::TyApp`] carrying the types it was
//! instantiated at. So each term has exactly one type, computable in one
//! bottom-up pass with nothing to infer — which is what makes [`lint`] cheap
//! and total, and what makes an optimisation pass *checkable*.
//!
//! That is the whole reason for the types. An inlining that substitutes the
//! wrong type, a specialization that drops a type argument, a `case` rebuilt
//! with an arm of the wrong type — each is a miscompile that runs, and runs
//! wrong. GHC's answer is a typed core and `-dcore-lint`; this is the same
//! answer, and the lint runs after every pass in a debug build and in the
//! whole test suite.
//!
//! Two conventions are worth knowing before reading the types:
//!
//! * A core type is an [`meadow_infer::Type`] in which **`Var(n)` is a rigid
//!   type variable** — bound by an enclosing `TyLam`, never solved by
//!   anything. `Bound` does not appear; a core polytype ([`Poly`]) writes its
//!   binders down instead of numbering them.
//! * [`unknown`] is the type of something the compiler could not type, which
//!   only happens in a unit that already has errors. The lint accepts it
//!   anywhere.
//!
//! # What is downstream
//!
//! Nothing. [`erase`] drops the type abstractions on the way out, and AxCut,
//! the bytecode machine and the CEK evaluator are all untyped: none of them
//! can ask a question a type would answer.
