//! **Values crossing between threads.** Each green thread has a heap of its
//! own (`crate::ctx`), so what one hands another -- a spawned function and
//! what it captures, a message, a thread's answer, a `TVar`'s value -- is
//! copied: out of the sender's heap into a parcel, which belongs to no heap,
//! and out of the parcel into the receiver's. Sharing within the value is
//! kept, so a structure that is a DAG arrives as one.
//!
//! Immutable data copies without anyone being able to tell. What cannot be
//! copied so is refused, as `meadow-rts` refuses it: a `Ref`, a mutable array,
//! a continuation. A thread, a channel or a `TVar` is a handle to something
//! the scheduler keeps, and crosses as the same handle.
