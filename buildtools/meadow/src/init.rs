//! `meadow init` — write the smallest thing the rest of the tools will accept
//! as a package.
//!
//! Which is not much: a `Meadow.toml` naming the package, and a `src/Main.mw`
//! with an entry point in it. [`crate::package`] would in fact accept a bare
//! directory of `.mw` files and name the package after the directory, so what
//! this really buys is the *name* — written down, rather than inferred from
//! wherever the directory happens to sit — and a file that already runs.
//!
//! And a `.gitignore` for the `target` directory builds write into (see
//! [`crate::artifacts`]), since nothing in it belongs in version control.
//!
//! Made inside a workspace, the package joins it: it is added to `members`
//! unless a pattern there already covers it, and gets no `.gitignore`, since
//! it builds into the workspace's `target`. `--workspace` makes the workspace
//! itself -- see [`crate::workspace`].
