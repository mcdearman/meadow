//! The AxCut abstract machine — **the IR's reference semantics**.
//!
//! A transcription of `Semantics.idr` from the OOPSLA 2025 artifact: a
//! statement, a program, and an environment, and seven transitions between them
//! — plus three more for effects, which AxCut does not have.
//!
//! It lives beside the IR rather than in the runtime, because it is not a
//! runtime. `meadow_rts` executes bytecode and knows nothing about sequents; the
//! whole point of `meadow_codegen` is that everything in this file is compiled
//! away. What this is for:
//!
//! * **Pinning down what the IR means** before a code generator gets an opinion
//!   about it. When the VM and this disagree, one of them is wrong and there is
//!   a small enough thing to read to find out which.
//! * **Checking the lowering on its own.** [`crate::lower`] has to get the shape
//!   of the environment exactly right at every program point — see its module
//!   docs — and running the result against the CEK machine tests precisely
//!   that, with no register allocation in the way.
//!
//! # The environment is the whole story
//!
//! There is no stack of frames and no notion of "the current registers" beyond a
//! single ordered list of values. Every transition rebuilds it:
//!
//! ```text
//!   substitute [x, y]   env := [lookup x, lookup y]      (and nothing else)
//!   jump L              env unchanged, renamed by L's parameters
//!   let x = K(a, b)     env := K(a, b) :: env
//!   switch x            env := fields(x) ++ env
//!   new f {…}           env := f :: env
//!   invoke f#i          env := captures(f) ++ (env without f)
//!   extern p(…)         env := result :: env    (a branch leaves env alone)
//! ```
//!
//! A block's parameters name *the entire environment* on entry, not just what is
//! new — so every transition here checks that the length matches, and a mismatch
//! is a bug in the lowering rather than in the program. That check is the point:
//! it is what turns "the register allocation is implicit in the IR" from a claim
//! into something enforced.
//!
//! # Effects
//!
//! Nothing here knows about them. The lowering has turned `handle` and
//! `perform` into evidence passing -- ordinary objects, data and jumps -- so
//! the only effect this machine meets is an [`Extern::Native`], an operation no
//! handler in the program answers.
//!
//! # Divergences from the CEK machine
//!
//! Three, all recorded here rather than hidden:
//!
//! * **`let` and `new` do not consume.** The paper's environment is linear and
//!   both build from a prefix which they then drop. Here they prepend and leave
//!   the rest alone. `substitute` is still the only shrinking operation, and the
//!   lowering emits one at every call and return, so environments stay bounded.
//! * **A definition is re-evaluated at every reference.** The lowering turns a
//!   global — and a `letrec` binding — into a `jump`, which is what makes
//!   recursion need no back-patching; the CEK instead evaluates each definition
//!   once at load. For a right-hand side that is a lambda or a literal the two
//!   agree. For one that performs an effect they do not, and the fix is a
//!   memoising thunk per definition.
//! * **No native effects.** An unhandled `Fs`, `Process`, `Random` or `Time`
//!   operation is an error here; the CEK discharges it against the real world.
//!   `Test.fail` is the exception, because a test runner needs it.
