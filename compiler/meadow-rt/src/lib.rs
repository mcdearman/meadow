//! **The runtime interface**: what every engine that runs a program -- the

//!
//! Descriptors ([`desc`]), the numeric tower ([`num`]), text and hashing
//! rules ([`text`], [`hash`]), compact regions ([`compact`]), what may cross
//! between threads or sit in a `TVar` ([`thread`], [`stm`]), the console's
//! colours ([`console`]) and the process's arguments ([`args`]), the

/// it does not build a closure for a subexpression that cannot transfer control,
/// a saturated call to a known function is a jump rather than three allocations,
/// and a primitive names its operand registers instead of gathering them. Those
/// cost nothing — no code size, no compile time worth measuring, no fidelity —
/// so turning them off would only make a debug build ten times slower for no
/// benefit to anyone. Nothing on this ladder controls them.

/// What the ladder controls is the work that *trades* something.

/// | | adds | costs |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `O0` | nothing | — |
/// | `O1` | native code keeps the machine's books only where they are observed, with short encodings | — |
/// | `O2` | `match` compiled to a decision tree; generic code specialized; native loops kept inside one function, hot registers in machine registers | code size, compile time |
///
/// The native rows are the code generator's (`meadow_glade::codegen`), which the
/// JIT and ahead-of-time executables share. `O1` is the default, and it is
/// where a pass lands that is worth doing on every keystroke. `O0` exists so
/// that a suspected miscompilation can be bisected against a compiler doing
