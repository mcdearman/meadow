//! The fingerprint of the sources that decide the ABI between the code this
//! crate emits and the runtime it links against, as `MEADOW_SILO_FINGERPRINT`:
//! this crate's, and `aot`'s. The runtime exports a symbol named after it
//! (`silo/build.rs` hashes the same trees with the same function,
//! `glade/fingerprint.rs`), and the emitted module refers to that symbol, so a
//! program links only with a runtime built from the same sources.
