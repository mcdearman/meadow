//! The virtual machine.
//!
//! A program counter, a flat register file and a collected heap. That is the
//! whole of it — there is **no call stack**, and no handler stack either: the
//! compiler passes effect handlers as evidence, so a `handle` and a `perform`
//! arrive here as ordinary objects and jumps, and only an operation no handler
//! answers reaches the machine, as [`Op::Native`].
//!
//! # Why there is no call stack
//!
//! Because the compiler already removed the need for one. In the sequent IR the
//! back end works from, a function is handed the continuation it should answer,
//! and returning is entering that continuation. A closure, a continuation and a
//! handler are the same kind of heap object, and [`Op::Invoke`] does the same
//! thing to all three: rebuild the register file as the object's captures
//! followed by its arguments, and jump.
//!
//! So nothing is pushed on a call and nothing is popped on a return. Recursion
//! grows the heap, which is collected, rather than a stack, which is not. A
//! tail call is not an optimisation here; it is what an ordinary call already
//! is.
//!
//! # Registers and the collector
//!
//! One flat file of 256 registers, no frame pointer. The compiler uses 255 of
//! them; the top one is [`TEMP`], where a fused compare-and-branch puts the
//! boolean it is about to throw away. The collector's root set is
//! `r0..live`, and `live` is maintained by the instructions that know it:
//! [`Op::Jump`] carries the target block's arity, [`Op::Invoke`] sets it from the
//! object's captures plus its arguments, and any instruction writing `r[a]`
//! raises it to `a + 1`. Registers above `live` are dead by construction; ones
//! below it may be stale, which retains a bounded amount of garbage and is the
//! price of not emitting liveness metadata per instruction.
//!
//! # A register is a word
//!
//! Nothing in a register says what it is: an `Int`, a `Float` and an address
//! are all 64 bits. What the compiler knows about them it writes down beside
//! the code, and the machine reads it where it needs it:
//!
//! * **what an operand is.** An instruction that has to know -- a primitive, an
//!   object built from registers, a `halt` -- has operand descriptors
//!   ([`meadow_bytecode::Program::operands`]): a descriptor, or the register
//!   holding one when the value's type is a type variable. [`Vm::value`] reads
//!   a register as the [`Value`] they say, and the primitives, `show` and the
//!   natives go on working with values. An instruction that only moves a word
//!   -- `move`, `field`, `invoke` -- never asks, and neither does a typed one
//!   -- `addi`, `brf` -- whose opcode says what its operands are.
//! * **which registers the collector follows.** Every instruction that can
//!   collect carries a map ([`meadow_bytecode::GcMap`]) of the registers the
//!   program still names there and what each holds -- a reference, a scalar,
//!   or whatever the descriptor in another register says -- and the collector
//!   roots exactly those. `MEADOW_GC_VERIFY` overwrites every register the map
//!   leaves out, so a map that forgets something fails loudly instead of
//!   rarely.
//!
//! Heap objects say what their fields are in their headers -- see
//! [`crate::object`].
//!
//! The rule the whole file obeys: **never hold an address across an
//! allocation.** [`Vm::ensure`] is called first, with room for everything the
//! operation will build, and arguments are read out of registers afterwards.
//! Registers are roots; Rust locals are not.
