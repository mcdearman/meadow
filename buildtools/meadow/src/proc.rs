//! Running a procedural macro while the package that calls it is compiled.
//!
//! The compiler cannot do this on its own: a macro is a compiled function, and
//! running one means linking a program and evaluating it, which is this crate's
//! job. So the compiler asks, through
//! [`Runner`](meadow_compiler::expand::proc::Runner), and this answers.
//!
//! What crosses is `Std.Macro`'s `TokenTree`, and the `Datum`s of the
//! compile-time bindings the call can see. Going in, both are built as terms
//! -- `Array`s of constructors, handed to `Vector.fromArray`, which is how a
//! `[a]` is made without knowing how one is laid out. The macro is run under
//! `Std.Macro.expanding`, the handler of its `Expand` effect, which answers
//! its `lookup`s from those bindings and writes what happened into a `Wire`:
//! arrays all the way down, which the evaluator hands over as plain `Vec`s,
//! so nothing here has to know how a `[a]` is laid out either.
//!
//! It runs on Glade's bytecode machine. Every macro the build can call is put
//! behind `Std.Macro.Serve.serve` in one image, compiled the first time a macro is
//! called and kept for the build; a run is handed what the call gives the
//! macro -- whether the round is settled, the bindings it can see, the
//! argument -- as a `Wire` written out on its input, and writes the `Wire` it
//! answers on its output. A program the bytecode back end cannot translate has
//! its macros run by the CEK machine instead, the way they were before: the
//! same terms, built as values rather than text.
//!
//! What each call answered is kept, beside the package that made the call, in
//! `target/<profile>/incremental/<name>-<options>.macros`, under a fingerprint
//! of every package a macro could live in: a build after an edit that touched
//! no macro, and an editor opening the package, answer every call from it
//! without running anything.
//!
//! Two things make this safe to do during a build. A macro's signature forbids
//! the effects that would let it learn anything about the world, so what it
//! answers depends only on what it was given and what it read -- which is why
//! the answers are cached here on exactly that. And it runs with a step
//! budget, so a macro that does not stop fails the build instead of hanging
//! it.
