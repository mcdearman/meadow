//! **Linearization**: AxCut with every share and every erase written down.
//!
//! In the AxCut paper (see `docs/SILO.md`) the environment is linear: every
//! name is used exactly once, a `substitute` that names a variable _n_ times
//! shares it _n_ − 1 times and one that leaves it out erases it, and every
//! other statement consumes what it names. Memory is then managed by the
//! program itself, with a reference count per block and no collector.
//!
//! `meadow_seq`'s AxCut is not linear -- `let`, `new` and `switch` read what
//! they name and leave it in the environment, and a `substitute` need not list
//! the names it drops (see its module docs) -- because the bytecode backend
//! collects instead. This pass makes it linear: it works out, at every
//! statement, which names are used again, and
//!
//! - **shares** a name where something consumes it and it is used again, or
//!   is consumed more than once;
//! - **erases** a name the moment nothing uses it again -- on entry to every
//!   statement, before it runs, so memory comes back as early as it can.
//!
//! What it produces, [`L`], consumes exactly as the paper's statements do:
//! `let` its fields, `new` its captures, `switch` its scrutinee (an arm loads
//! the fields), `invoke` the object and the arguments, `jump` the whole
//! environment. A primitive borrows its arguments.
//!
//! A `switch` decides per arm. An arm that still wants the scrutinee --
//! `match o with | Just x -> o`, or an arm of a decision tree that tests a
//! value and then uses it whole -- *keeps* it: it borrows the fields it uses,
//! sharing each, and the scrutinee stays its own. Every other arm consumes
//! the scrutinee, and so is the one that can build in its block. Deciding for
//! the whole `switch` at once, as this pass used to, shared the scrutinee
//! before it whenever any arm wanted it, and no arm could reuse it.
//!
//! A kept scrutinee can still be reused on a path that no longer wants it:
//! where it is erased there, and something after builds a block its size,
//! the erase is a `DropReuse` (Perceus's *drop-reuse*) -- when it was the
//! last reference, its references to its fields are given up and its block
//! is the token; when it was not, it is erased as usual and the token holds
//! nothing. `if k < x then … (ins l k) … else t` keeps `t` for the one path
//! that returns it, and rebuilds in it on the others.
//!
//! **Reuse** (FBIP, after Perceus). An arm that takes a block apart and then,
//! before anything else could want the memory, builds a block of the same size
//! is given the old one to build in: `switch` binds a *reuse token* in the arm
//! -- the scrutinee's block when it was the last reference, whose fields the
//! arm has just been handed, or nothing when it was shared -- and the first
//! `let` of as many fields on each path out of the arm builds in it. A path
//! that builds nothing that size gives the token back (`Clean`) where it
//! parts from the paths that do, so the memory is never held longer than it
//! could be used. `map` over a list it holds the only reference to rebuilds
//! the list in place.
//!
//! **Borrowing** (after Lean 4's borrow inference, Ullrich and de Moura,
//! _Counting Immutable Beans_, IFL 2019). A definition's parameter is
//! *borrowed* when its block only reads it: switches on it, hands it to
//! primitives, or passes it on to another borrowed parameter. The caller keeps
//! its reference; the block neither erases it nor, reading its fields, counts
//! them -- a switch on a borrowed name keeps it, and its fields are borrowed
//! too. Where a borrowed name is consumed after all -- built into a block,
//! captured, invoked with, passed to an owned parameter -- it is shared first.
//!
//! Which parameters are borrowed is worked out over the whole program
//! ([`program`]): each starts borrowed, and one becomes owned when its block
//! consumes it, or when a switch on it could rebuild in its block. Only ever
//! from borrowed to owned, so it ends.
//!
//! A caller that hands a borrowed parameter an owned value it has no further
//! use for -- `check (build n)` -- would have to keep it past the call to give
//! it up: Lean's `dec` after a call, which walks a tree a second time to free
//! what the callee could have freed as it went. It calls a copy of the block
//! instead, in which those parameters are owned: made for each set of them
//! some caller needs, and linearized like any other block. A copy that
//! recurses on what it owns calls itself.
//!
//! A non-tail call is a frame and a jump. In a block whose activation can
//! never be captured ([`Program::pure`]), a frame handed straight on as the
//! jump's continuation runs before the block's caller goes on, so it may
//! borrow what the block borrowed: its method takes those parameters
//! borrowed. In any other block a frame owns what it holds, since a handler
//! may keep a captured continuation longer than the block's caller keeps
//! anything.
//!
//! A name whose representation is not a reference is tracked the same way --
//! the environment is one list -- but sharing and erasing it does nothing, so
//! no statement is written for it. A name of a type variable's type is shared
//! and erased with the descriptor it is described by, and the emitted code
//! asks the descriptor.
