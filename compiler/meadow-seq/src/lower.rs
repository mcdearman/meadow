//! `core` → AxCut.
//!
//! The translation is the classical one: **a value is returned by invoking a
//! continuation**. A continuation is codata with a single method, so returning
//! needs no mechanism of its own —
//!
//! ```text
//!   substitute [k, v] in {(k, v) => invoke k#0}
//! ```
//!
//! — and a function is codata too, with one method taking an argument and the
//! continuation to answer with. Calling and returning are one operation seen
//! from its two sides, which is the duality the IR is named for.
//!
//! Everything in `core` is covered. [`Unsupported`] has one variant left, for a
//! variable that is neither in scope nor a definition, which is a bug upstream
//! rather than a gap here.
//!
//! # The environment is positional, and this pass has to know its shape
//!
//! This is the part that makes the IR worth having and the pass awkward to
//! write. A block's parameters are not "the new bindings" — they name *the whole
//! environment* at that point, in order. So the translation cannot emit a
//! statement without knowing exactly what is live and in what order, and every
//! function here threads that list explicitly.
//!
//! The payoff is that nothing downstream has to reconstruct it. `substitute` is
//! literally the move sequence; `jump` and `invoke` carry no arguments because
//! there is nothing left to pass. A register allocator reads its answer off the
//! IR instead of computing liveness.
//!
//! The price is paid here, in [`Lower::bind`], which must be handed the set of
//! names that survive the subexpression it is sequencing — and that set is
//! computed from the free variables of everything still to come.
//!
//! # Definitions are labels, and so are `letrec` bindings
//!
//! A reference to a global lowers to `substitute [k] in {(k) => jump L}`: `jump`
//! leaves the environment alone, and the definition's block takes exactly the
//! continuation, so the two line up with no shuffling at all. Recursion needs no
//! back-patching, which is the reason to do it this way.
//!
//! `letrec` is the same mechanism with the free variables made explicit — plain
//! lambda lifting. A group's bindings share one parameter list, the variables
//! they capture from the enclosing scope, and a reference to one becomes
//! `substitute [a, b, k] in {(a, b, k) => jump L}`. Mutual recursion then costs
//! nothing extra, and no object has to point at itself, which is what a
//! closure-based encoding would need and which no `Rc` graph should have to do.
//!
//! It does mean such a binding is re-evaluated at every reference rather than
//! once, the way the CEK machine does it. For a right-hand side that is a lambda
//! or a literal — nearly all of them — that is unobservable. For one that
//! performs an effect it is not, and fixing it means giving each definition a
//! memoising thunk. See the note in [`crate::machine`].
//!
//! # Pattern matching
//!
//! `match` compiles to a chain of failure continuations: one codata object per
//! arm, each capturing the next, and a pattern that fails invokes it. That is
//! backtracking, not a decision tree — arms can retest what an earlier arm
//! already tested, so a wide `match` on one scrutinee does more work than it
//! needs to. It is correct and it is small.
//!
//! At [`OptLevel::O2`] a `match` whose patterns are constructors, literals,
//! tuples and variables -- nearly all of them -- is a decision tree instead,
//! [`Lower::case_matrix`]: every value is tested once, nothing is built to
//! backtrack with, and each `switch` can consume what it takes apart, which is
//! what lets the reference-counted backend build in the blocks a match took
//! apart. An arm reached from more than one leaf is copied to each while it is
//! small and becomes a label they jump to when it is not. What the tree does not
//! take -- arrays, records, a tree too big -- falls to [`Lower::case_tree`], one
//! `switch` over a prefix of distinct constructors, and then to the chain. It is
//! gated because a decision tree is a code-size trade in general, and because
//! the chain is what the arms fall back to, so all of them have to keep working.
//!
//! # Where this departs from the paper
//!
//! The paper's environment is **linear**: `let` and `new` consume the prefix
//! they build from. Here they prepend and leave the rest alone, so a name may be
//! used twice without an explicit duplication. `substitute` is still the only
//! thing that shrinks the environment, and it appears at every call and return,
//! so environments stay bounded — but the linearity that lets the paper's
//! backend place registers without analysis is not yet enforced.
//!
//! # Effects: evidence passing
//!
//! AxCut has no handlers, and after this pass Meadow's has none either. A
//! `handle` and a `perform` lower to ordinary objects, data and jumps, so every
//! engine below -- the reference machine, the bytecode VM, native code -- runs
//! effects without knowing they exist.
//!
//! **The evidence.** Every function takes one parameter more than it is
//! written with: the handlers installed where it was called, as a list of
//! `#ev(key, clause, target, rest)` entries, newest first. `key` names the
//! operation (`"State.get"`), `clause` is an object whose one method is that
//! operation's clause, and `target` is a `Ref` holding where the whole `handle`
//! expression's value goes. The empty list is a `#evnone` object. A continuation does not
//! take it: it captures the evidence it needs like any other name, which is
//! also why resuming a continuation needs no evidence restored.
//!
//! **`handle body with clauses`** allocates `target = Ref k`, one clause object
//! per clause, and one entry per clause on top of the current evidence, then
//! runs `body` with that as its evidence and a return continuation `H` as its
//! continuation. `H` reads `target` and runs the `return` clause there, under
//! the evidence outside the handler.
//!
//! **`perform E.op x`** searches the evidence for `"E.op"` -- a jump to a small
//! block of its own, [`Lower::perform`] -- and then, with the entry found,
//! builds a one-shot resumption `R` and enters the clause with `x`, `R`, and
//! the value in `target`. With none found, the operation goes to the runtime
//! ([`Extern::Native`]): `Console`, `Fs` and the others the real world answers.
//!
//! **A tail-resumptive clause** -- `op x k -> k e`, which is most of them --
//! is entered with `x` and the performing code's own continuation instead, and
//! answers it with `e`: no resumption, no flag, nothing written. `k e` would
//! have done exactly that and sent what came of it where the clause's value
//! goes, which is the same place.
//!
//! **`resume v`**, called as `R` with continuation `c`, checks and sets `R`'s
//! flag, sets `target := c`, and continues the performing code with `v`. That
//! write is what makes handlers deep and the clause's `resume` return: when the
//! resumed body finishes, `H` reads the resume site out of `target`. It is safe
//! because a resumption runs at most once.
//!
//! Clauses and the `return` clause capture the evidence from outside the
//! handler, so an operation they perform goes past it, as it must.
//!
//! # Types: descriptors
//!
//! A value whose type is a type variable is represented however the variable
//! is instantiated, and something at run time has to say how -- the collector,
//! once values stop saying it themselves. So type abstraction and application,
//! which erase to nothing in most compilers, pass *descriptors* here
//! (`meadow_core::desc`): one per variable over types, none for rows and
//! effects.
//!
//! * **A generic definition** takes its descriptors first, in both of its
//!   blocks; a `letrec` binding takes them after what its group captures.
//! * **A generic `let`** is an object whose one method takes the descriptors
//!   and a continuation and evaluates the right-hand side -- once per
//!   instantiation, which is unobservable because only a pure right-hand side
//!   is generalized.
//! * **An instantiation** `f [T, …]` passes a constant for each known type and
//!   the descriptor in scope for each variable ([`Lower::with_descs`]).
//!
//! Every name's [`Rep::Var`] is the name of its variable's descriptor where it
//! is bound. Liveness here ignores descriptors; [`crate::describe`] then adds
//! each one to every environment holding a value it describes.
