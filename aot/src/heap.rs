//! **Blocks, counted by reference**, the AxCut paper's way (`docs/AOT.md`).
//!
//! A reference is a word: `0` is nothing, an odd word is an object with no
//! block (a nullary constructor, a closure with no captures), and any other
//! word is the address of a block:
//!
//! ```text
//! word 0   extra references: u32 (0: the only one) | length: u32
//! word 1   kind: u8 | element descriptor: u4 | uniform: u1 | … | meta: u32
//! words    field descriptors, four bits each, sixteen to a word
//!          (absent for a uniform block, whose one descriptor is in word 1)
//! fields
//! ```
//!
//! What the paper does, and so what this does:
//!
//! - **share** adds one to the count;
//! - **erase** takes one from it, or -- if it was the last -- puts the block on
//!   the list of blocks _pending_, fields and all, without looking inside;
//! - **clean**: a block whose fields were moved out by the last reference
//!   loading them (the paper's `release`) is reusable at once;
//! - **acquire** takes a clean block of the size wanted, or fresh memory --
//!   and first erases some of what is pending, a bounded amount, so that no
//!   operation ever walks a structure and garbage never waits for long.
//!
//! The paper has one size of block and chains a bigger object through its last
//! field; Meadow has arrays and strings, which want indexing, so blocks come in
//! a size class per word count, with anything bigger allocated on its own.
