//! **Strings on the heap.**
//!
//! A `String` is an object of [`Kind::Str`]: its UTF-8 bytes, packed eight to
//! a word. It used to be an interned key, which made every string a program
//! built live as long as the process -- a compiler making names and output by
//! the million would only ever grow -- and made taking one apart copy the whole
//! of it into an array first. Now a string is garbage like anything else, and
//! reading its length, a byte or a slice costs what it reads.
//!
//! Interned keys remain for what is not a `String`: a record's labels and the
//! name an effect operation is dispatched on ([`Value::Str`], `desc::STR`).
//!
//! A string is UTF-8 whatever made it. Everything that builds one from bytes
//! that might not be -- a slice through a character, `bytesToString` --
//! replaces what is not with U+FFFD first, as `meadow_core::text` says.
