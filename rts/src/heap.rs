//! The heap: a nursery, an old generation marked while the program runs, and
//! the regions it refers to.
//!
//! Every green thread has a heap of its own, so everything here is one
//! thread's business, and a pause stops only that thread. What this module is
//! built around is keeping those pauses short however much the thread keeps
//! alive -- well under a millisecond -- rather than making the total time spent
//! collecting as small as it can be.
//!
//! # The nursery
//!
//! New objects are bumped into the nursery, and when it fills it is collected
//! the Cheney way: the roots are copied into the other half, the copies are
//! scanned as a queue and what they reach copied after them, and what is left
//! behind is garbage in bulk. That costs what survives, and almost nothing
//! does. What has survived one nursery collection already is **promoted** into
//! the old generation at the next, so nothing is copied back and forth for long,
//! and the nursery has a fixed largest size -- [`GcConfig::nursery`] -- so a
//! nursery collection has a fixed longest pause.
//!
//! Until a heap fills its largest nursery, nothing is promoted and the nursery
//! just grows: most green threads never keep enough alive to need an old
//! generation at all, and pay nothing for one.
//!
//! # The old generation
//!
//! Immix blocks and lines -- see [`crate::old`] -- where objects do not move
//! while a cycle marks. It is collected by marking what is reachable, on another OS thread while the
//! program runs -- see [`crate::mark`] -- and then treating every line nothing
//! marked as free. A cycle costs the program two pauses: one to empty the
//! nursery and hand the roots to the marker, and one when marking is done, to
//! adopt its result. Neither does work that grows with the old generation.
//!
//! A cycle begins when the old generation has grown by as much as the last
//! cycle found alive (or [`GcConfig::min_trigger`], if that is more): memory
//! is traded for fewer cycles, and a program that keeps more alive is marked
//! less often for it.
//!
//! Between cycles, the sparsest blocks are **evacuated** a block or two per
//! pause: their survivors copied somewhere denser and the blocks given back.
//! Finding every pointer to a moved object without tracing the heap takes
//! lists the marker and the barriers keep -- see [`crate::evacuate`].
//! [`GcConfig::evacuate`] turns it off: less memory given back, and a slightly
//! shorter tail of pauses.
//!
//! # The remembered set
//!
//! A nursery collection does not look at the old generation, so it has to be
//! told where the old generation points into the nursery: those fields are its
//! remembered set, and it treats them as roots. Such a pointer can only be made
//! three ways -- promoting an object whose field points at something that stays
//! young, allocating a large object straight into the old generation, and
//! overwriting a field of a `Ref`, a mutable array or a resumption -- and each
//! of those checks and records. Data in Meadow is immutable, so the barrier on
//! an ordinary field write, which a generational collector for Java pays on
//! every assignment, is not there at all.
//!
//! # The rule the rest of the runtime has to obey
//!
//! Objects in the nursery move. An [`Addr`] held anywhere the collector cannot
//! see becomes wrong the moment a collection happens -- so the VM never holds
//! one across an allocation. It calls [`crate::Vm::ensure`] first, with room
//! for everything an operation will build, and only then reads its arguments
//! out of registers. Registers are roots; Rust locals are not.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! Every slot is one word. An object is a header, then its fields, each the
//! bits of a value and nothing else; what each field holds is a descriptor in
//! the header -- see [`crate::object`]:
//!
//! ```text
//!   addr        kind, len, and for an array its one descriptor
//!   addr+1      meta, and the first fields' descriptors
//!   ...         more descriptors, for a wide object
//!   addr+h      field 0
//!   ...
//! ```
//!
//! `meta` is per-kind: a constructor tag, a method table, a sign. A collector
//! finds addresses by descriptor, the same way for every kind, so there are no
//! per-kind tracing rules. What this module hands out and takes in is still a
//! [`Value`], which is a field's word and its descriptor together.
//!
//! An address says where it points by its range: below [`OLD_BASE`] the
//! nursery, below [`REGION_BASE`] the old generation, and above that a region.
//!
//! # Compact regions
//!
//! `compact` moves a structure out of the heap into a **region** -- see
//! [`crate::region`] -- which no heap owns and no collector copies or scans. A
//! heap only refers to the regions it has addresses into: an address into one,
//! or a [`Kind::Compact`] handle naming it, found while collecting keeps the
//! heap's reference, and a region a whole collection did not reach is let go.
//! A region several heaps refer to is read by all of them, with no copying,
//! which is what lets compacted data, and a `TVar`'s value, be shared between
//! threads. With an old generation in use, only a finished marking cycle has
//! seen everything, so only that lets a region go.
//!
//! # The other collector
//!
//! [`Collector::Copying`] is the nursery alone, growing without limit and
//! never promoting: one Cheney semispace collector, as this heap was before it
//! had generations. It is there to compare against.
