//! Cut lowered to AxCut: the upper IR to the lower, which the runtimes
//! compile.
//!
//! Cut names its values and says where each goes. AxCut has no names to
//! speak of: an environment, in order, which every block's parameters list
//! whole, and seven statements that are each a cut with the rule it meets.
//! So lowering is deciding what is in the environment at each point, and
//! writing each cut as the statement it is:
//!
//! ```text
//!   <K(x, ..) | μ̃ y. s>          let y = K#t(x, ..); s
//!   <cocase { .. } | μ̃ f. s>     new f [what it mentions] { .. }; s
//!   <x | case { K(..) => s }>     switch x { #t (fields, env) => s }
//!   <f | m(x, ..; k, ..)>         substitute [f, x, .., k, ..]; invoke f#m
//!   <x | k>                       substitute [k, x]; invoke k#0
//!   f(x, ..; k, ..)               substitute [x, .., k, ..]; jump f
//!   prim op(x, ..; c)             extern op(x, ..) -> (r, env); r to c
//! ```
//!
//! A consumer that is not a name already -- a `μ̃`, a `case` -- and has to be
//! one, to be passed, is made an object of one method that takes the value:
//! what it mentions from around it, captured. An object captures only what
//! its methods mention, in the order the environment has them.
//!
//! A top-level value is a global of the machine's, by its place among the
//! program's: the block a program starts at computes each in turn and then
//! calls the entry.
//!
//! # Effects: evidence passing
//!
//! AxCut has no handlers. Every definition and every method takes one
//! argument more than it is written with: the handlers in scope where it
//! was called, a list of `#ev(key, clause, target, rest)` entries, newest
//! first, that ends in `#evnone`. A consumer made an object captures it.
//!
//! `handle` keeps where its value goes in a `Ref`, the `target`; makes an
//! object of each clause, and an entry for it on the evidence; and runs its
//! body under that, answering a continuation that reads the target and runs
//! the `return` clause there. `perform` looks its operation up -- a jump to
//! a block of the program's that walks the list -- and enters the clause
//! found with its arguments, a resumption, and what the target holds. The
//! resumption is a function: called with a value and a continuation, it
//! makes that continuation the target and goes on from the `perform`, which
//! is what makes a handler deep. An operation no entry answers is the
//! runtime's, if the `native` table binds it, and an error if not.
//!
//! In a program where an operation is marked `@many`, every continuation
//! is an object on the heap and a resumption is not checked to be called
//! once: one called again goes on from the `perform` again, which is what
//! such an operation wants.
//!
//! In any other program -- every one of Meadow's -- the continuation a
//! call is made with to answer through is a **frame** (`Program::frames`),
//! which the back ends keep on a stack: the native one, on Silo. So a
//! handled body runs on a segment of the stack of its own (`Enter`), an
//! operation whose clause is given its continuation cuts the segments
//! between it and its handler off (`Detach`), and the resumption, which is
//! checked to be called once, puts them back (`Reattach`): `meadow_seq`'s
//! lowering of the same, `docs/SILO.md`'s "Effects: stack segments".
//! `MEADOW_CUT_FRAMES=none` keeps everything on the heap, for telling a
//! fault in this from one anywhere else.
//!
//! # Representations: descriptors
//!
//! A definition generic in a representation takes, for each variable, a
//! descriptor: a number that says which representation the variable is
//! where it was called. A name represented as a variable says so by its
//! descriptor's name, and wherever such a name is, its descriptor is too:
//! `meadow_axcut::describe` adds it to each environment that lacks it, as
//! it does for this compiler's own lowering.
//!
//! **Not lowered**: a `μ` where a value is wanted, anywhere but as the
//! argument of a definition whose parameter says how it is represented. A
//! program with one is refused, saying so.
