//! **Native code, from bytecode.**
//!
//! A baseline compiler: each block of bytecode (see [`crate::abi`]) becomes one
//! native function, instruction by instruction. What a word-level instruction
//! does -- a move, a constant, typed arithmetic, a compare-and-branch -- is
//! done inline, on the register file in memory. Everything else is handed back
//! to the interpreter one instruction at a time, through
//! [`crate::abi::meadow_exec`], and native code carries on or returns according
//! to what became of control.
//!
//! So the machine code is a translation of the typed bytecode, not a second
//! compiler: every engine runs the same instructions, and the difference is
//! only which of them an engine does itself.
//!
//! Two architectures, [`Arch::Aarch64`] and [`Arch::X86_64`], behind one small
//! [`Emit`] interface, and the same translation for both. The code needs no
//! relocations: it reaches the machine through fixed offsets in [`crate::Vm`]
//! -- see [`layout`] -- branches only within a function, and calls the
//! interpreter through a pointer the machine holds. That is what lets one
//! translation serve an object file on disk ([`object`]) and memory made
//! executable in place alike.
//!
//! # What native code keeps up
//!
//! The machine state an instruction changes: the register it writes, `live`
//! when that raises it, the pc when control leaves, and `steps`, counted in a
//! machine register and added to the machine's before every call and return.
//!
//! # Optimization
//!
//! The same [`OptLevel`] as the rest of the compiler, and the same promise:
//! each level runs the same instructions to the same effect, and differs only
//! in what it costs.
//!
//! * [`OptLevel::O0`] is the translation done literally, instruction by
//!   instruction: what a miscompilation is bisected against.
//! * [`OptLevel::O1`] keeps the machine's books where they are *observed*
//!   rather than where they change -- see [`Book`] -- and picks the short
//!   encodings of instructions with a constant operand. A run of arithmetic
//!   between two calls into the interpreter costs one addition to the step
//!   counter and at most one write to `live`, where it cost one of each per
//!   instruction. And it *chains* -- see below.
//! * [`OptLevel::O2`] adds two passes that trade code size for speed. A
//!   block's function takes in the code that loops back into it (see
//!   [`region`]), so a loop whose body the bytecode lays out as blocks of their
//!   own runs round natively instead of returning to the machine at every
//!   block. And the registers that function uses most live in machine
//!   registers (see [`pins`]), in memory only where something other than the
//!   function could look.
//!
//! # Chaining
//!
//! Every transfer of control in the bytecode is a tail call -- a jump to a
//! block with its arguments in the registers, or an invoke of a closure,
//! which is also how a function returns -- so nothing is left on the native
//! stack when control leaves a block. Without chaining, native code returns to
//! [`crate::Vm::advance`] there, which looks up the next block's function and
//! calls it: a return, a trip round the scheduler's loop and a prologue for
//! every call and every return in the program.
//!
//! Every function builds the same frame, so from [`OptLevel::O1`] one goes
//! straight on to the next instead ([`Emit::chain`]): it writes its pinned
//! registers back and jumps to the other function's *warm entry*, [`Emit::WARM`]
//! bytes in, past the frame. The frame, the uncounted steps and the loop count
//! carry on. In a whole program's code the target is a known label; for a
//! function compiled on its own, and for an invoke's target, it is found in the
//! machine's table of native functions ([`layout::NATIVE_TABLE`]) -- and where
//! that has nothing yet, the function returns as before, and the JIT counts
//! the entry. [`CHAINS`] such jumps in one call from the machine, and it
//! returns anyway, so the scheduler still gets its turn.
