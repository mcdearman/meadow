//! Pruning a program to what its entry reaches (`meadow_core::prune`) must not
//! change what it does -- on any machine. The REPL runs every line that way.
//!
//! Each program below runs whole and pruned, on the CEK machine, the bytecode
//! VM and the JIT, and has to answer the same both ways -- and pruning has to
//! have actually dropped something, or the test proves nothing.
