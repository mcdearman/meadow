//! The scheduler: green threads, each with a heap of its own, run M:N on a pool
//! of OS threads.
//!
//! # What a green thread is
//!
//! A [`Vm`]: a register file, a program counter, a handler stack and a heap.
//! The machine has no call stack, so that is all of it -- a thread that is not
//! running is a value that can be put in a queue, and any OS thread can pick
//! it up and carry on. The OS threads are workers and nothing else; a program
//! never sees one.
//!
//! # The rule: a heap belongs to one thread
//!
//! Only the OS thread currently running a green thread touches that thread's
//! heap. Values reach another thread in three ways -- the function it is
//! spawned with, a message on a channel, the result `await` returns -- and each
//! is exported to a [`Parcel`] by the thread that has the value, and imported by
//! the thread that receives it, when it next runs. A parcel waiting in a channel
//! belongs to no heap at all. So there is no shared mutable memory between
//! threads, no locking in the machine, and each heap is collected on its own
//! with nothing else stopping.
//!
//! # Work stealing
//!
//! Every worker has a run queue of its own. A thread it spawns, a thread it
//! wakes -- by sending to a channel someone waits on, or by finishing a thread
//! someone awaits -- and a thread of its own that used up its slice all go on
//! *its* queue, so a thread keeps to the core it is on and its heap stays in
//! that core's cache. A worker with nothing to do takes half of another
//! worker's queue: work spreads to idle cores, and only to idle cores.
//!
//! A thread woken by a message or a result goes one better: into the worker's
//! *next* slot, which is not stealable and runs as soon as the current thread
//! stops. A send and the receive it answers then happen on one core, back to
//! back, the way a pipeline wants -- where waking a sleeping core to carry every
//! message across would cost more than the message. A worker is woken to steal
//! only when a queue holds more than its owner will run next.
//!
//! One shared queue remains for fairness: a worker looks at it first every
//! [`GLOBAL_EVERY`] turns. The locks are per queue, per channel and per thread
//! handle, so workers that are not touching the same things do not wait on each
//! other.
//!
//! # How a thread operation happens
//!
//! A primitive cannot carry one out: the channels and the other threads are
//! here. It leaves a [`Request`] in the machine and returns, and the worker
//! running the machine does what was asked, then either carries on with the
//! same thread -- a send, a spawn, a new channel -- or parks it with whatever
//! it is waiting for: a receive on an empty channel, an `await` on a thread
//! still running. Whoever wakes it attaches the answer as a [`Wake`], and it is
//! delivered into the thread's registers when it runs again.
//!
//! # Fairness, deadlock and the end
//!
//! A thread runs for [`SLICE`] instructions and then goes to the back of its
//! worker's queue, so a loop that never waits cannot starve the others. The
//! program ends when its first thread -- `main` -- does, as in Go; threads still
//! running then are dropped.
//!
//! Only a running thread can wake a waiting one. So the scheduler counts the
//! threads that are running or queued, and if that count reaches zero with
//! `main` unfinished, every thread is waiting on another and none ever will
//! stop: a deadlock, reported as an error.
