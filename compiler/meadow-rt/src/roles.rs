//! **Roles: the values a runtime builds or recognizes by itself.**
//!
//! A native operation answers with an optional value or a result, splits a
//! line it read into a list, or makes a vector; `show` prints a list or a
//! vector as the sequence it is, and a tuple as a tuple. None of that is the
//! program's doing, so a runtime has to know which of the program's
//! constructors to build and to look for -- and which it is is the front end's
//! business, not the runtime's: Meadow's optional value is `Maybe.Just`,
//! another language's may be `Option.Some`. So a program declares, for each
//! [`Role`], the constructor that plays it (`meadow_axcut::Program::roles`),
//! and a runtime asks for the role, never for a name.
//!
//! What a role promises is its shape, the same in every language that
//! declares it -- [`Role::shape`] says it. A program that declares none of a
//! role's constructors is one no runtime builds that value for: an operation
//! that would have to says so instead.
//!
//! A few names are the IR's own rather than any language's: a tuple's
//! constructor ([`TUPLE`]) and the evidence an effect is performed with
//! ([`evidence`]). Those every front end uses as they are.

/// A part a constructor plays for the runtimes.
