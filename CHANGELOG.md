# Changelog

What changed in each release of Meadow: the language, the standard library,
`Meadow.toml`, and the tools. Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).
While the major version is 0, a minor version may break source and a patch may
not. The promise covers the language, `Std`'s public API and `Meadow.toml`; the
bytecode image, the Cut IR and the runtimes' layouts may change in any release
until 1.0.

Each release has three lists: what **breaks** code that built before, what is
**added**, and what is **fixed**. A nightly build is `master`, and what it has
beyond the last release is under _Unreleased_.

## Unreleased

### Breaking

- The lockfile is `Meadow.lock`, spelt as `Meadow.toml` is. One named
  `meadow.lock` is still read, and is renamed the first time the lock is
  written; commit the rename.

- `[a..b]` stops before `b`, as Rust's `a..b` does, and `[a..=b]` includes it.
  Both included `b` before: the parser read the two alike. Write `..=` where
  a range is to reach its end -- `[1..=10]` for one to ten.
- An unstable feature is asked for in the source, not in `Meadow.toml`:
  `@!feature(ffi)` at the top of the package's root module, as Rust's
  `#![feature(…)]` is at the top of a crate's. `features = ["ffi"]` under
  `[package]` is an error that says so. A lone file that uses `Std.Ffi` asks
  the same way; a nightly let it through unasked before.
- `meadow fmt` prints a file from its tokens, as rustfmt does, and no longer
  keeps the line breaks it was written with: the same code comes out the same
  however it was typed. What fits in the width is one line and what does not
  is cut at its outermost joint first. Every file it formatted before is
  formatted differently now; run it once over a project. It kept the lines a
  file had, and cut or joined them by rules that depended on where they were,
  so two layouts of one function could both count as formatted.
- `meadow fmt` keeps lines within 100 columns by default, as rustfmt does. It
  was 80. `--width 80` asks for the old width.

### Added

- The Meadow colour theme for VS Code, **Meadow Dark** and **Meadow Light**, is
  an extension of its own in `editors/vscode-theme`: a colour for each kind of
  name the language server tells apart. Each release attaches it as
  `meadow-theme-<version>.vsix`, and `scripts/install.sh --with-extension`
  installs it beside the language extension.
- `meadow cut FILE -- ARGS` gives the program what follows `--` as its
  arguments.
- A program of Cut may spawn threads: `prim threadSpawn(desc(rep), f; k)`
  says how what the thread answers is represented. And a top-level `val` is
  made the first time a thread reads it, not when the program starts, so a
  thread other than the first has it too.

- The language server answers `meadow/ir`: the definition at a position as
  core, Cut or AxCut, with what each part of the text is and where the name
  at the position is in it. The VS Code extension's **Meadow: Show IR** shows
  it beside the source and follows the cursor.
- The REPL shows a definition in the compiler's IRs: `:ir NAME` prints it as
  core, as Cut and as the AxCut the runtimes are handed, and `:ir core NAME`,
  `:ir cut NAME` or `:ir axcut NAME` one of them. The Cut is core lowered for
  showing: a program is not compiled through it yet.
- `meadow cut FILE` runs a program written in Cut, the IR a front end hands
  the back end (`docs/CUT.md`): on Glade, or with `--runtime silo` as a native
  executable. It takes programs that handle no effects of their own so far.
- A trait can have associated effects: `effect Reading r` in the trait, a row
  in each `impl` (`effect Reading Done = {}`, `effect Reading (Writing s) = {
St s }`), and `! Reading r` where a method's type says what it performs. A
  function generic over the trait performs what its type's `impl` says.
- A trait's parameter can be an effect: one a method performs, `trait Rows r e
{ fun slot : r -> Int ! e }`. An `impl` gives a row for it, `impl Rows
(Writing s) { St s | e }`, or a variable, and is found by the other
  parameters.
- `@fmt(skip)` on a declaration, or on a line of its own before one, has
  `meadow fmt` leave it exactly as it is written, as `#[rustfmt::skip]` does.
- A record update takes a field by its name alone, as construction does:
  `{ r | x, y = 2 }` is `{ r | x = x, y = 2 }`. An update of one field still
  writes its `=`, since `{ r | x }` is the extension of `x` with a field `r`.
- `@!name(…)` before a module's first declaration is an attribute of the
  module. `@!feature(…)` is the one there is.
- A package has features, as a Cargo crate does: `[features]` in `Meadow.toml`
  names them, each with the features it turns on with it, and `default` is the
  ones on unless a build says not. `--features a,b`, `--no-default-features`
  and `--all-features` choose among the features of the package being built,
  a dependency is written `{ …, features = ["a"], default-features = false }`
  to choose among its own, and the source asks with `@cfg(feature = "a")`. A
  feature the package does not declare is an error that lists the ones it has.
- `meadow fmt` sets a record out as rustfmt sets out a struct: its brace on the
  line of what it belongs to, a field to a line, and the closing brace back
  under the start of that line. A function given last to a call starts on the
  call's line, as a closure does there.
- `meadow fmt` gives a declaration's head that does not fit a line to each
  thing it takes and one to its type, as rustfmt does a signature.
- `meadow fmt` puts what is written over several lines back on one when it fits
  the width: a definition and its body, a call and its arguments, an arm and
  what it answers, a record and its fields, an `if` and its branches. The
  steps of a `let … in` have a line each, and the arms of a `match`, unless
  there are two short ones.
- Formatting on save in an editor does what `meadow fmt` does.
- `meadow fmt` puts a space between a name and a `{` written against it,
  `Ctor{` to `Ctor {`.
- The REPL starts with a short banner, so its name is still on the screen at
  the first prompt, and `:help` lists the commands and the keys.
- The REPL's banner and the tutorial say which keys force a new line on macOS:
  `Ctrl+J` always, and Option+Return once the terminal sends Option as Meta.
- The REPL colours what is typed as the language server would: the entry is
  compiled against the session as it is typed, so types, constructors,
  modules, functions and variables each have a colour, by what each name
  resolved to and its type. The `name : type` line an entry prints is
  coloured too.
- The language server's semantic tokens mark a name whose type is a function
  as `function`; every lower-case name was `variable`.

### Fixed

- A build keeps the release its lock names when a newer one has been tagged
  since. On a machine that had not fetched the dependency yet, a dependency
  taken by `version` was resolved to the newest release before the lock was
  looked at, and the lock's commit was then refused as "a tag that moves" --
  so tagging a release broke every lock written before it, until
  `meadow update`.

- Two builds fetching the same dependency at once no longer fail with
  "could not put … in place": each unpacks into a directory of its own, and
  the one that finishes second finds the checkout there. On Windows the two
  wrote into, and removed, one staging directory.
- `meadow fmt` keeps what an associated effect is on its line in an `impl`,
  `effect Reading (Writing s) = { St s }`. It laid the row out as the fields
  of an `effect` declaration, a label a line.
- A trait used at a type with the caller's own type variables in it -- an
  `impl` for `Builder s`, inside a function generic in `s`, as everything run
  under a `runSt` is -- is compiled away in a release build as it is at a
  known type. Its dictionary was looked up and its method called at run time.
- A small function that takes a value apart and is inlined where its answer
  is needed -- an accessor, a trait's reader at a known type -- no longer
  costs a continuation frame on every call: what waits for a one-armed
  `match` on a constructor goes into its arm, as it already did for a `match`
  with several.
- A trait used inside a `runSt` at a type that names its state -- `label cell`
  for a `Cell s` made in there, through a function generic over the trait --
  was refused as the state escaping. What such a use asks for is answered
  before the `runSt` closes.
- `meadow fmt` keeps the lines of a macro call's body when one of them has a
  comma in it: `lang! { pub Core extends Base with In, set` and a rule to a
  line after it came out with each line ending in the first word of the next.
- `meadow fmt` puts a declaration back at the margin that an earlier version
  had pushed in from it -- after a string that ran over lines, everything
  that followed was set out as more of the expression before.
- Formatting on save does not wait for the language server to finish
  analysing: it is answered from the text at once, on a thread of its own, and
  of several changes to a document waiting to be analysed only the last is.
  In a package with macros to expand a save took seconds.
- `Std.Ffi` answers an error for the null address where it crashed: reading or
  writing through a pointer that is 0, which is what `alloc` gives where there
  is no C library to ask, as on Windows.
- `meadow fmt` puts the line after a `let … in` level with the `let`. A second
  `let` written further in stayed there, and its `in` with it, so the body
  under them was out of line with both.
- `meadow fmt` places the `in` of a `let` written in brackets. It sent that
  `in` to the left margin and lost its place in the bracket for the lines
  after. A bracketed `let` is now laid out with its value four in, its `in`
  two in, and its body on the `in`'s line when they fit; and a line that
  carries another on moves with it when that line is moved.
- The finder reads a signature still being typed as the start of one, so
  `(a -> b) -> [a;]` finds `map` first. It took the last type typed for the
  result, and put `drop` first: a list comes back from it, and its first
  argument is a type variable, which a function fits.
- The finder reads `[a;]` in a type as a list. It dropped the `;` and looked
  for a vector, so `(a -> b) -> [a;] -> [b;]` did not find a `map` over lists.
- Two builds that fetch the same git dependency at once take turns in its
  cache. One could find the other's unfinished clone and report that the
  repository "has no releases".

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-04

The first release with a version that does not move. Before it there was one
release, `v0.1.0-alpha`, republished from `master`; from here on a version is
published once, and `master` is the nightly channel.

### Breaking

- `[a..b]` stops before `b`, as Rust's `a..b` does, and `[a..=b]` includes it.
  Both included `b` before: the parser read the two alike. Write `..=` where
  a range is to reach its end -- `[1..=10]` for one to ten.
- `Std.Ffi` is unstable. A package that uses it says so in its `Meadow.toml`,
  `features = ["ffi"]`, and a stable `meadow` refuses it; a nightly accepts it.
- `Std.Ffi.Arg`'s constructors are `Arg.Int`, `Arg.Float`, `Arg.String` and
  `Arg.Ptr`. They were `IntArg`, `FloatArg`, `StringArg` and `PtrArg`.
- `Std.String.Parse.Lexer.IndentOpt`'s constructors are `IndentOpt.None`,
  `IndentOpt.Many` and `IndentOpt.Some`. They were `IndentNone`, `IndentMany`
  and `IndentSome`.
- `meadow fmt` cuts lines longer than 80 columns by default. `--width N` sets
  another width and `--width 0` leaves long lines alone.
- A module under the one being written is a qualifier by its name: after
  `mod Core`, `Core.name` means that module's `name`. A `use … as Core`
  written in the same module still wins.

### Added

- Channels. `meadowup default stable` or `nightly` says which releases
  `meadowup update` follows; `meadowup install 0.2.0` installs a version.
  `meadow --version` says which a build is.
- `features = […]` under `[package]` in `Meadow.toml`: the unstable features a
  package uses.
- A `meadow-toolchain` file beside a `Meadow.toml`, holding `stable`, `nightly`
  or a version: `meadow` refuses to build the project with another toolchain
  and says how to get the one it asks for.
- Modules written inside a file, `mod Name { … }`, which nest. A module under
  the current one is reached by its path, `Core.Expr.name`, and so are its
  types' constructors and its pattern synonyms. `use super (…)` names the
  module a module is written in.
- `Std.Ffi`: opening a C library, calling its functions, and reading and
  writing C's memory.
- `Std.Terminal`: raw mode, reading keys, and the terminal's size.
- `Std.String.Parse.keep` and `skip`, for parsers written as pipelines.
- `meadow build --emit expanded` writes each module with its macros expanded.
- `--nursery SIZE`, and `nursery = "8M"` in a profile: how large Glade's
  nursery may grow.
- Syntax highlighting in the REPL.
- `Std.Json` reads through a byte scanner, about twenty times faster.

### Fixed

- Silo on aarch64 passes nothing on the stack, which works around an LLVM bug
  that overwrote a caller's value and crashed programs built with `-O 0`.
- A build is the same from one run to the next, and Silo reuses the object
  files of modules that did not change.
- A `match` on a run of constructors lowers to one switch at every
  optimisation level.
- `@pub` and `@cfg(…)` written in a macro rule's template mean what they say.
  A declaration a rule marked `@pub` was private.
- A pattern synonym reached through a qualifier, `E.Lit n` after
  `use … as E`, is resolved through it.
