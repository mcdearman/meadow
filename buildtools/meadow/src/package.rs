//! The unit of compilation is a **package**: a directory of modules plus a list of
//! dependency packages. Modules inside one package may refer to each other freely
//! (mutual recursion is fine); packages form a DAG and may not — a dependency cycle
//! is a hard error, exactly like cargo crates.
//!
//! Discovery is filesystem-based. A package root optionally carries a
//! `Meadow.toml` manifest, in a Cargo-like format:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [package]
//! name = "demo"
//! version = "0.1.0"
//!
//! [dependencies]
//! util = "../util"                 # bare string = path
//! shared = { path = "../shared" }  # inline table with `path`
//! ```
//!
//! `[package]` name/version may also be given at the top level, and the legacy
//! file name `Meadow.pkg` is still accepted. Without a manifest the directory (or
//! single `.mw` file) is a standalone package named after its stem. The embedded
//! `Std` package (see [`crate::stdlib`]) is always an implicit dependency and
//! never needs to be listed.
//!
//! A manifest may also configure the build profiles, which is how a package
//! changes what `--debug` and `--release` mean for it:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [profile.debug]
//! opt-level = 1            # 0, 1, 2 — or "O1"
//!
//! [profile.release]
//! opt-level = 2
//! strictness = "strict"    # "lenient" | "strict"
//! backend = "aot"          # "vm" | "jit" | "aot"
//! prune = true             # compile only what `main` reaches
//! cfg = "fast, feature=gpu" # flags `@cfg(…)` can test
//! ```
//!
//! Only the keys that are present are overridden; the rest keep the profile's
//! built-in meaning (see [`crate::Profile`]). A command-line flag wins over
//! both.
//!
//! Several packages can share one root manifest as a **workspace** -- one
//! `target`, one set of profiles, versions and dependencies written once. A
//! member takes those with `version.workspace = true` and
//! `util = { workspace = true }`; see [`crate::workspace`].
